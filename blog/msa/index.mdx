## Before We Start

> Let's make sure we're on the same page with terminology

### Domain

> A unit that logically implements actions and responsibilities (This could either be logic or policy)

I won't make a diagram for this.

### Service

> A unit that provides data/behavior as a single function (`domain + data`)

If it's about a product, it could be named product service.

```kroki type=d2
vars: {
  d2-config.sketch: true
}

product-service: {
  domain
  data: {shape: cylinder}
}

shipping-service: {
  domain
  data: {shape: cylinder}
}
```

### Application

> A unit that combines one or more services and a user interface (`service + user interface`)

```kroki type=d2
vars: {
  d2-config.sketch: true
  domain: {
    domain
    data: { shape: cylinder }
  }
}

order-service: {...${domain}}
product-service: {...${domain}}
shipping-service: {...${domain}}

order-management-application -> order-service
order-management-application -> product-service

shipping-management-application -> product-service
shipping-management-application -> shipping-service
```

## What is MSA?

> It is about breaking your applications into small pieces (services) which do specific jobs that match their domain.

That is why it is called `Micro Service Architecture`

### Should I go for it?

I can't give you an answer. \
It's your call.

Just remember this before you adopt MSA.

<HighlightOrange text="Martin Fowler said," />

> **Don't even consider microservices unless you have a system that's too complex to manage as a monolith.**

### Bright side

- Can prevent the failure of Service A from propagating to Services B, C, and D.
- Able to implement distributed systems flexibly and consistently
- Free from considerations in adopting HW / SW technologies. (just matching interface will do)
- Reduction in build & test time.

### Dark side

- Development complexity and proficiency
- transaction management
- testing (when multiple services are involved)
- maintenance (troubleshooting, monitoring)

## Some points I want to talk about MSA

> Personally, I think it's all about **making boundaries of the domain.**

Do `Event Storming` and determine where things should be. \
We'll start from there.

### Avoid Too Many Microservices Being Made

I saw an ugly case. \
There were so many microservices, there were some services no one knew. Heard the name, but had no idea what it did.

If you consider adopting MSA, \
You need to compromise at the point where your team can manage when defining the domain. \
Even though the functions it provides don't match its name.

<HighlightOrange text="Try not to make a new domain service every time." />\ If
you already have too many microservices that you can't handle, merge them.

### If `DB transaction` is a viable option, use it

Separating all the databases into pieces and implementing `Distributed Transaction` could be a stupid approach.

I'm not saying `Distributed Transaction` such as `SAGA`, `2PC` are not good.

Those are cool stuff, but it's going to take a lot of resources to develop/maintain them.

What I'm trying to say is, `DB transaction` is what you can almost always rely on.

### Filter out domains that can't be changed due to external dependencies

Don't mess with them.
