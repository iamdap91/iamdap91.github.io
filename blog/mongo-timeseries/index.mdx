## Before We Start

We must talk about what `Timeseries Data` is.

### Timeseries Data

> A time series is a sequence of data points collected or recorded at successive points in time, typically at uniform intervals.

`TimeseriesDB` is `Database` that stores `Timeseries Data`.

## How It differs from traditional DB?

> It's always better to see, rather than explain.

| ![rdb.gif](rdb.gif) | ![timeseries.gif](timeseries.gif) |
| :-----------------: | :-------------------------------: |
|     `normal DB`     |          `Timeseries DB`          |

## Features

> <HighlightOrange text="As you can see, It Indexes Data by Time range." /> \
> Every Pros and cons comes from this.

- Made for storing large set of data
- Stores data chunks by time range
- Optimized for `INSERT` & `SELECT`
  - Barely provides `DELETE` & `UPDATE`

## Bucket Pattern

Before Timeseries, There was `Schema Design Pattern`, `Bucket pattern`. \
It is primitive version of Timeseries collection. \
I'll show you how to implement `Bucket pattern`.

> ![bucket_pattern](./bucket_pattern.png)

Normally, you'd store data like left image. \
indexing by id.

In `Bucket Pattern`, indexes data by `time(start_date, end_date)` and `sensor_id`.

This was efficient in `1:N relations`, but were some issues. \
If BSON size limit of 16 MB is exceeded, special handling needs to be performed, such as separating the loaded data and retrieving it again.

Starting from `MongoDB 5.x`, the support for `Time series collection` that internally implements the bucket pattern does the job for us.

## etc

You might wanna see how data is actually stored.

Take a look at `system.bucket.[COLLECTION_NAME]`.
