## What is `CORS`?

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system, consisting of transmitting HTTP headers, that determines whether browsers block frontend JavaScript code from accessing responses for cross-origin requests.**

ㄴ️Technically, that is the definition of CORS, but down below is what I think.

> Mechanism to block unwanted requests in browser.

## Preflight Request?

Before CORS how CORS cuts off unwanted requests, We have to talk about what preflight request is.

I'll try to make it short.

```kroki type=d2
vars: {
    d2-config: {
      sketch: true
    }
}
shape: sequence_diagram

Browser -> Server.1:  preflight request
Server.1 -> Browser:  preflight response

Browser -> Server.2:  actual request
Server.2 -> Browser:  actual response
```

If you make actual request(by event or something), browser make pre-request to see server is aware using specific methods and headers.

This is basic behavior browser does before it make request.

By using this, we can avoid server running which we're not going to take data from and can ensure safety (by getting data from known sources).

### Without Preflight Request

```kroki type=d2
vars: {
    d2-config: {
      sketch: true
    }
}
shape: sequence_diagram
Client -> Browser.1:        Request \n origin: foo.com
Browser -> Server.2:        Request \n origin: foo.com
Server -> Server:           Server runs
Server.2 -> Browser:        Response \n Allow-Origin x
Browser.1 -> Client:        CORS 에러!
```

### Using Preflight Request

```kroki type=d2
vars: {
    d2-config: {
      sketch: true
    }
}
shape: sequence_diagram
Client -> Browser:        Preflight Request \n origin: foo.com
Browser -> Server:        Preflight Request \n origin: foo.com
Server -> Browser:        Response \n Allow-Origin x
Browser -> Client:        CORS Error!
Client -> Browser:        Making No Request. {
	style: {
		stroke-dash: 3
		animated: true
	}
}
```

## How `CORS` Works

browser verifies whether origin allowed by `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` field of header in response.

This looks upon whether `protocol + host + port` is same.

| protocol | host       | port | path | query string | fragment |
| -------- | ---------- | ---- | ---- | ------------ | -------- |
| https:// | google.com | :443 | path | ?name=sam    | #cache   |

## How to deal with `CORS`?

- Mod server to return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` field in response.
  - Try not to use `*`. This could possibly make serious security issues.
- Use Reverse proxy of Webpack Dev Server.
